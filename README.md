# Description

## Features

- Ability to solve Sudoku puzzles of sizes 9x9 and 16x16.
- Heuristic algorithm for efficient solving.
- Loading puzzles from files.
- Saving solved puzzles to files.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Usage

1. **Input Files**: Create input files containing Sudoku puzzles in the specified format. The puzzle should be represented as a square grid, with each cell containing a number from 1 to 9 (for a 9x9 puzzle) or from 1 to 16 (for a 16x16 puzzle). Empty cells should be represented by 0.

2. **Build**: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.

3. **Run**: Execute the compiled binary, providing the input file name as a command-line argument. The solver will attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle and output the result.

## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic of the Sudoku Solver.
- `SudokuSolver.h` and `SudokuSolver.cpp`: Define the `SudokuSolver` class and its methods for solving Sudoku puzzles.
- `Sample Inputs/`: Directory containing sample input files for testing.
- `Sample Solutions & Outputs/`: Directory to store the solved puzzles generated by the solver.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.
